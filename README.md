# 🎓 Interactive RCA Pipeline Tutorial

> **Learn Root Cause Analysis through hands-on experience with real-world data pipelines**

**🌐 [Try the Live Demo](https://learn-rca-lstm.streamlit.app/)**

An educational Streamlit application that demonstrates how modern AI systems automatically detect and diagnose failures in production environments by analyzing log data. Perfect for students, data engineers, and ML practitioners.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **ETL Processing**: Transform unstructured logs (XML, JSON, plain text) into structured data
- **Sessionization**: Group events into meaningful user journeys
- **Vectorization**: Convert text sequences into numerical representations for machine learning
- **LSTM Networks**: Train recurrent neural networks to learn "normal" system behavior
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify failure patterns and root causes automatically
- **Production Considerations**: Understand supervised vs. unsupervised approaches for real-world deployment

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**: Interactive 6-stage pipeline with detailed explanations at each step
- **Visual Learning**: Charts, metrics, and visualizations to understand data transformations
- **Real Analogies**: Complex concepts explained through everyday analogies
- **Synthetic Data**: Safe sandbox environment with controlled test cases
- **Deep Dive Tools**: Forensic analysis of individual order journeys
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Automated root cause suggestions based on failure patterns

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (interactive web UI)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas (ETL & sessionization)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras LSTM (sequence modeling)
- **Visualization**: Plotly (interactive charts)
